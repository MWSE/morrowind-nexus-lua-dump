This is a dump of all lua code found in mods published on the Morrowind Nexus.

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide developers with insights on how various parts of the lua API are being used.

This repository is not suitable for downloading mods! Only raw lua code is included, with no guarantees about being up-to-date, nor with any additional dependencies that may be required.

If you're a mod developer and do not want your code mirrored here let us know by creating an issue.
