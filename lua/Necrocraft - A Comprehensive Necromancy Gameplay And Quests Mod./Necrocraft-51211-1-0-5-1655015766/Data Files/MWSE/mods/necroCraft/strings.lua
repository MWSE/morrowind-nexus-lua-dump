- Added mechanics to consider creature soul a black one.
- Liches are now considered to have black souls
- Added alpha version of Lichdom. How to become a lich is an ingame mystery. The solution is intertwined with other mod content such as quests and spells. Some thematic artifacts from the vanilla game may come in handy as well.

Daris Adran or Treras Dres - Black Soulgem Creation
Tirer Belvayn ? 


Once a group of lowly smugglers showed me disrespect. I showed them how terrible a death can be. All of them but one. Their leader Bakarak ran like a coward he is. I left him go to spread the rumors of my immesurable power, but instead he dares mixing my name with the dirt and hires mercenaries to fight me. Such disgrace, such insolence...
I want you to raise an army of undead and destroy Bakarak and his mercenaries. I want their spinal cords ripped alive, their still beating hearts stuffed into their throats, I want them to see how their comrades fall victims to overhelming torture and then raise as bonewalkers joining the assault on those who is left.
I want their screams heard across all Vvardenfell! I want Sea of Ghosts red with their blood! I want so that all the Tamriel knew what happens when you oppose the Maggot King!

Choice "Where can I find them?" 1

Ask Luven. He is been keeping an eye on this old friend of his.

He was seen in Vos a couple of days ago. You should probably ask there. I bet someone from Varo Tradehose could tell you more. Bakarak could never miss an opportunity to brag about his plans with a jar of cheap booze in his hand. Heh. good old times.

Choice "Anything else?" 1 "You were friends with him, weren't you?" 2

He is a redguard, proficient with a mace. He is a capable fighter

Yes I was. But then Master Goris ordered me to betray Bakarak and all the others. And so I did.

Choice "Why did you obey?" 3

I... don't understand the question. He is my Master. How could I not?

Bakarak you say? Isn't he leader of Maggot Stompers?

Weird name, yeah. A group of adventurers as I understand. I've heard them talk about going to Falensarano to hire Alfhedil Elf-Hewer. And then hunt some necromancer. An elf one, I suppose.
