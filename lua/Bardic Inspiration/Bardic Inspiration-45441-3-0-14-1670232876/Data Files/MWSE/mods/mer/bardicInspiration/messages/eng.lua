[[Bardic Inspiration allows you to book performances at taverns and perform with a lute.

Before you can perform, you need a lute, and some music to play. To learn a song, talk to an NPC with the "Bard" class and select the "teach me a song" topic. The NPC must have sufficiently high disposition towards you. If you're having trouble finding a bard, talk to an innkeeper and ask to perform, and they may point out a nearby bard to you.

To give a performance, speak to an innkeeper before 6pm and select the "give a performance" topic. Once you have accepted the gig, come back after 6pm and ready your lute. You will then be able to select a song to perform.

As you are performing, you will earn tips from nearby patrons. The amount you earn in tips depends on your Luck, Performance skill, and the difficulty of the song.

Once you have finished performing, speak to the innkeeper again to get your payment (this is in addition to the tips you earned).

Songs have 3 difficutly levels: beginner, intermediate and advanced. Bards will only teach you higher difficulty songs if your skill level is high enough. Bards have a limited number of songs they know, and some may know the same songs, so one character is unlikely to learn all ~40 of the songs available.
