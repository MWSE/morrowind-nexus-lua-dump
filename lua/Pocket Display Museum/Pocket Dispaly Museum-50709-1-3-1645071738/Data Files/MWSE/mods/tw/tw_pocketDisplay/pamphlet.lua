As you are reading this then you should now have the Museum travel spell available to use.
When cast it will take you to the museum, if cast while in the museum it will return you to where you came from.
You could also use any teleportation spell or item to leave the museum there are no restrictions on leaving this way.

Instructions:
<BR>

When you first arrive all the lights will be turned off, so it will be fairly dark.
Look for the Push Switch, mostly near the door's, to turn the lights on/off, these are toggle switchs.

To add your items to the displays is simple.
Open a 'Display Safe' and select 'Auto'
This will automagically remove any known display item from your inventory and place them securely in the safe.
Any item stored in the safe that is a known display item will automagically be displayed in the Museum.
<BR>
You may remove any item from the safe at any time, just open the safe to retrieve the item.
Note: removing any item from the safe will also remove it from the displays.
<BR>

In the curators room there a four special mannequins.
When activated you will be presented with a menu. Selecting 'Open' will just open the normal companion share menu, 
selecting 'Swap' will do just that it will swap whatever you are wearing with whatever the mannequin is wearing, and visa versa.
At the same time anything else that was manually added to the mannequin will be transferred to you as well.
<BR>
<BR>
Throughout the museum you will find Cloud Storage Containers, these like all such container are 'cross mod' linked containers.
There are also many normal containers to use if you prefer the mannual method of storing your stuff.
<BR>
Also if you wish to spend your time manually placing all your items, then don't put anything into the safe,
you can then use all the display areas to display whatever you want wherever you wish.
<BR>
<BR>
There are plenty of mannequins, both male and female, for you to display any armor or clothing you want.
This is purely a manual option and not automated.
As there are many suits of armor that can be considered are race related there are male and female mannequins for each race.
<BR>
<BR>
Information:
Throughout the museum there are display plaque's activating them will give you further information about the items in that display. 
<BR>
<BR>
You may find my bag of holding extremely useful for collecting items for the museum displays. 
Look for: "The Explorers Magical Bag" on the Nexus.
