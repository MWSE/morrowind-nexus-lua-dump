Mace of Slurring:
<BR>
The Mace of Slurring was crafted near the end of the Second Era by Kyanka, a slightly deranged Altmer weaponsmith and enchanter.

Magic users all over Tamriel have been searching for it ever since to benefit from its magical protection.

Staff of Magnus:
<BR>
The Staff of Magnus, also called the Golden Staff, is one of the elder artifacts of Tamriel. It was created by Arch-Mage Magnus, the God of Magic who aided Lorkhan in designing Mundus.

BiPolar Blade:
<BR>
The BiPolar Blade is a strange artifact of some renown. According to legend, a nobleman sank his fortune into creating a longsword of supreme power. Two smiths on opposite ends of Tamriel created each half of the blade, unaware of the other, with the hope that no one man, save the owner of the blade, would know its true power. Unfortunately, the smiths were not given enough instruction, and created halves with enchantments that completely negated each other. One half of the blade is golden, and the other half is made of a brown metal. The sword is enchanted with the ability to both magically calm and frenzy a humanoid. These conflicting enchantments make the blade practically useless, although the calming effect is dominant.

Chrysamere, also known as the Paladin's Blade, the Blade of Blades, and the Sword of Heroes, is an ancient adamantium claymore artifact with offensive capabilities only surpassed by its defenses.

The Umbra Sword is a Daedric artifact designed with the sole purpose of the entrapment of souls. Sometime before 2E 582, the ancient witch Naenra Waerr created the sword at the request of Clavicus Vile, who wanted the sword as a tool of mischief which would send him souls from the mortal realm.

Ice Blade of the Monarch:

The Ice Blade of the Monarch (or simply the Ice Blade) is a claymore prized by Tamrielians. Using the soul of a Frost Monarch, the Archmage Almion Celmo of the Summerset Isles enchanted the claymore of the great warrior Thurgnarr Assi, who attempted to use it to commit regicide in some distant land, and become the new ruler. The assassination failed and Almion Celmo was imprisoned. The sword freezes all who feel its edge, and goes from owner to owner, never settling for long.

The Goldbrand is an ancient artifact created by the dragons of the North which takes the form of a golden katana.

Scamp:
<BR>
Scamps are weak servants of Mehrunes Dagon. They are the most common type of Daedra found in Morrowind, but are also the weakest, though they are immune to unenchanted iron and steel weapons. 
<BR><BR>
Ogrim:
<BR>
Ogrim (or Ogrims) are large dim-witted Daedra with very little intellect, which are describable as "fat-faced ogres". They are chiefly sent into the mortal world to menace living things for the amusement of Daedra Princes.
<BR><BR>
Rat:
<BR>
Rats are rodents common to all of Tamriel. They can be found both in city sewers and the wilderness, and are known to carry a variety of diseases. Rats are often kept by goblins for food. Pack rats can be trained to carry or drag items.
<BR><BR>
Scrib:
<BR>
Scribs, also known as squibs or kwama scribs, are the larval form of the Kwama. They are not very aggressive, but can paralyze attackers. Pupal scribs are sometimes roasted over an open fire by Dunmer. Scribs are traditionally impaled to wooden plates and eaten alive
<BR><BR>
Kwama Forager
<BR>
Kwama Foragers scout land and caves, searching for prey as well as suitable locations for new colonies. Though aggressive, the Forager is not particularly dangerous.
<BR><BR>
Cliff Racer:
<BR>
Cliff Racers are large flying creatures found throughout Vvardenfell. They are very aggressive and will attack anyone in sight. Cliff Racers have good vision range, and will often detect and follow the player without being noticed. This can result in swarms of them descending upon the unwary adventurer. Their AI can be rather flawed at times; for example they often go to you using non-linear routes, similar to "zig-zag" flying, and can get stuck for a while in trees.

[[Molag Amur Region:
<BR>
The Molag Amur region is essentially the southern part of the Ashlands.
<BR>
Molag Amur is distinguished from the northern Ashlands by the presence of lava pools and rivers on the surface. The land is predominantly dark volcanic rock covered with an overlay of ash and cinder, but of a different makeup and appearance from that of the Ashlands proper.
<BR>
Molag Amur is generally an area one passes through out of necessity, not a place where any but the desperate would make a home.
<BR><BR>
There are also various Daedra frequently seen in the area, including all types of Atronachs:
<BR>
Atronach:
Flame:
<BR>
The Fire Atronach is a magical, fire-enchanted creature. Some are artificially constructed as a sort of golem[8]. Others are actually daedra[9], akin to the Flame Atronach. It is advised to use cold based spells when attacking one, as any fire spells actually heal the creature instead of damaging it. It gives off great heat which can damage an adventurer if they get too close.
<BR><BR>
Storm
<BR>
A powerful Shock Elemental Daedra native to a pocket realm of Oblivion called Levinace. They can be summoned, and are immune to normal weapons and shock, resistant to poison and can reflect spells and damage.
<BR><BR>
Frost:
<BR>
This powerful Elemental Daedra not only causes damage with its vicious physical attacks, but also from the extreme cold aura it generates, which makes it immune to cold-based spells. Frost Atronachs can be summoned by mages, and are often hunted as a source of Frost Salts.
<BR><BR>
<BR>
Skeletons:
<BR>
Skeletons are a form of Undead consisting of the reanimated bones of the dead. They're often found protecting the dungeons, forts and ruins of Tamriel. Many varieties of animated skeletons exist, some stronger than others. Skeletons have a certain resistance to edged weapons and frost spells.
