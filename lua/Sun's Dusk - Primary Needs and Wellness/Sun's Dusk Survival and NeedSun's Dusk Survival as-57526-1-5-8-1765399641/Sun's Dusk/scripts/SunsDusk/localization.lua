“Your body begs for sleep, but your mind never listens.”

🧭 How It’s Gained

The player goes long periods without resting — skipping normal sleep cycles, resting rarely or for very short durations.

Insomniacs live on the knife’s edge between brilliance and breakdown.
Common among Telvanni or cursed adventurers — those consumed by ambition or haunted by guilt.

“You feel the world bending at the edges. Sleep would dull the mind, and you cannot afford dullness.”

Access to unique hallucination events or insomnia dreams

Sleep rarely claims you, yet weariness bends to your will.
Each restless night hardens resolve, though the world grows distant.
